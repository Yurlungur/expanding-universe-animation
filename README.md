This is python code to generate an animation showing how the universe
expands. In the left frame, I show how the expansion of the universe
looks to us. The Earth is a red dot and all astronomical objects are
moving away from it. Nearer objects appear to be moving away from the
Earth less quickly than distant objects. (That's Hubble's law.)

In the right frame, I show how the expansion of the universe looks in
a different (arbitrary) reference frame. Again the Earth is a red
dot. The overall distance between each point in space is increasing at
a constant rate. This is the expanding universe we know and love.

A key point is that in an expanding universe, every point looks like
the center of an explosion, but there is no center. And there is no
explosion.
